<H2>Method:</H2>
<B>Over-representation</B> - Fisher test comparison of a selected list of genes to a defined list of reference genes <I>(i.e. genes on a chip)</I>.
Test measures the probabilty that a random list would contain as many genes as the selected list in a given GeneSet. p-values are corrected for
multiple testing using q-value correction.<BR>
<B>Percent-coverage</B> - Percent coverage is not a statistical test. It is used with presence - absence calls to identify the percent of a gene set category found in the selected list
as compared to the reference list.

<H2>Enter a list of genes to analyze:</H2>
Paste a list of entrez gene IDs in this box to compare to the selected gene sets. Non-numerical characters are considered to be delimiters
between gene ids. Multiple delimiters will be merged.

<BR>

<A NAME="PredefinedLists"></A>
<P>
<H2>Choose from predefined Entrez ID gene lists:</H2>
A number of pre-defined reference gene lists are available for Affymetrix chips. The lists are created from the 'Entrez Gene' column
from the annotation files provided by Affymetrix. Selecting <B>'--- Input a custom gene list (Entrez IDs) ---'</B> from the list
will open a new text box into which a custom list of entrez gene ids can be pasted.

<H2>Enter the set of genes from which the above list was selected:</H2>
Optional input field which is only used if the predefined set is set to '--- Input a custom gene list (Entrez IDs) ---'. This option
can be used with other reference lists created from other arrays or from other reference collections. (i.e. Genes in a cell-based
screening library, etc.) Paste your customized reference list of entrez gene identifiers into this box. Any non-numerical character
pasted into this box will be treated as a delimiter between IDs. Multiple consecutive delimiters will be treated as a single delimiter.
